# Developing on `inc`

At the current time, `inc` requires that you be on the nightly rust build for the `impl Trait` functionality.

It's recomended that you use https://www.rustup.rs to install rust and update to the nightly.

Once `exec` is functional, we'll get more here. But in the meantime, all you need to do is run `cargo build && cargo test`.
